This application uses the newer CameraX API and is compatible across many devices. It is programmed in Android Studio with Java as the language.

### About this app

Many phones do not come with the option to take long exposure photos. Phones that do often limit the time over which the image is captured. This app will allow for lengthier capture times, which can create interesting and beautiful images. It achieves the custom exposure effect by stacking images using a sum of means of pixel values.
